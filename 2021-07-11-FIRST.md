Today i'm going to use Github Pages to write my first blog.
And i'm trying to learn how to use Markdown.
For example, 
# This is the first title
## This is the second
###### and this may be the sixth
_italic_
__bold__
-[ ] job undone
-[x] job done
left row | right row
--------------------
first | second
and the final one, 'Hello world!'
